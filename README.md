# PyBer_Analysis Deliverables

## Overview of Analysis

### Upon joining the pseudo ride-sharing company named PyBer, I was tasked to read into two large .csv datasets and merge them into one dataframe for further analysis. The complete parent dataframe contained the columns: city, date, fare, ride_id, driver_count, and type. From the parent dataframe columns, new dataframes were created to be able to track metrics, obtain measures of central tendency, and plot meaningful, visual data. 7 figures were created for the ride-sharing analysis, 1 screenshot of the ride-sharing data summary dataframe is included, and 1 Figure for the "Total Fare by City Type." for the dates of 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019.

## Figures

### Figure 1.
A bubble chart was created that overlayed three bubble charts into one, containing: y-axis as "Average Fare ($)", x-axis as "Total Number of Rides (Per City)", title: "PyBer Ride-Sharing Data (2019)", a legend with a title of "City Types," for the three color specific city types (Urban, Suburban, Rural), and a chart note of "Note: Circle size correlates with driver count per city."

## Challenge Assignment

### 
To round off this PyBer company assignment, we were tasked to create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type as well as create a multiple-line graph that showed the total weekly fares for each city type within a specific date range.
